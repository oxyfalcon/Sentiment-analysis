      <h2>What is Depression ?</h2>
      <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling
        of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder
        or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and
        can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have
        trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel
        as if life isn't worth living.
        More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and
        you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment.
        But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better
        with medication, psychotherapy or both.</p>

      <p>For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough
        to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work,
        school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people
        may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.</p>

      <h2>How do we perform Sentiment Analysis ?</h2>
      <p>Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.
        Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand
        and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.</p>
      <p>We use this technique to identify early symptoms of Depression.</p>

      <h2>Emergency Help</h2>
      <p>If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.</p>
      <p>Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call your doctor or mental health professional.</li>
        <li>Call a suicide hotline number.</li>
        <li>Reach out to a close friend or loved one.</li>
        <li> If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt,
          make sure someone stays with that person.</li>
        <li>Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.</li>
        <li>Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the
          nearest hospital emergency room.</li>
      </ul>
